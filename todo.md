- add getAll in UserRepo (used by spotify-controller ðŸ¤®)
- replace getAll with getUsersAtParty or even better add rebuildQueue to userService or smth?
  - create queueService/repo, remove Queue from User!
- return new User objects from UserService after updates etc.
- Move spotify-controller: emptyQueue, to userService or queueService, make party-specific
- Remvoe Queue from Users and only use one Queue object per party
- Remove mainPlaylist, backupPlaylist, Queue from spotify-controller; manage in PartyService
- security, in an appropriate layer: User can't set parties they're not hosting, can't access hosts they shouldn't, etc. Don't trust incoming api data!
- continue ongoing parties/hosts when server restarts
- mock sockets in tests (e.g. SpotifyController)
- require backup playlists before starting a party
